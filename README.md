# D-Wave Instance Generator (D-WIG)

The D-WIG toolset is used to generate binary quadratic programs based on a specific D-Wave QPU.  A key motivation for generating problems on a specific QPU is that these problems do not require an embedding step to test them on the hardware.  The D-WIG problem generator assumes that the QPU has a chimera topology.

The D-WIG toolset includes,
* `bqp-schema.json` - a JSON-Schema for encoding Binary Quadratic Programs (B-QP), i.e. bqp-json
* `dwig.py` - a command line tool for generating B-QP instances in the bqp-json format
* `spin2bool.py` - a command line tool for converting a bqp-json data files between the spin and boolean variable spaces
* `bqp2qh.py` - a command line tool for converting bqp-json data files into a qubist compatible Hamiltonians
* `bqp2qubo.py` - a command line tool for converting bqp-json data into a qubo data

The remainder of this documentation assumes that,

1. You have access to a D-Wave QPU and the SAPI binaries
2. You are familiar with the D-Wave Qubist interface
3. You are using a bash terminal


## Installation

The D-WIG toolset requires `dwave-sapi2` and `jsonschema` to run and `pytest` for testing.
To install these requirements first make sure that the `dwave-sapi2` library is installed by running,
```
python <path to sapi>/install.py
```
Then the remaining dependencies can be installed via,
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The installation can be tested by running,
```
./test.it
```

## Introduction

### Basic Usage

The primary entry point of the D-WIG toolset is `dwig.py` this script is used to generate a variety of B-QP problems, which have been studied in the literature.  For example, the following command will generate a RAN1 problem for a full yield QPU of chimera degree 12 and send it to standard output,
```
./dwig.py ran
```
Bash stream redirection can be used to save the standard output to a file, for example,
```
./dwig.py ran > ran1.json
```
The `ran1.json` file is a json document in the bqp-json format.  A detailed description of this format can be found in the `BQP-JSON.md` file.

A helpful feature of D-WIG is to reduce the size of the QPU that you are working with.  The _chimera degree_ argument `-cd n` can be used to reduce D-WIG's view of the full QPU to a smaller n-by-n QPU.  For example try,
```
./dwig.py -cd 2 ran
```
A detailed list of all command line options can be viewed via,
```
./dwig.py --help
```


### Problem Types

The D-Wig toolset currently supports three types of problem generation,

1. __ran__ - the fields are couplers are set uniformly at random
2. __fl__ - frustrated loops
3. __wscn__ - weak-strong cluster networks

A detailed list of command line options for each problem type can be viewed via,
```
./dwig.py <problem type> --help
```
See the doc strings inside of `generator.py` for additional documentation on each of these problem types.


### Connecting to a QPU

Without any connection details, D-WIG will assume a full yield QPU of chimera degree 12.  Connection details are required to build B-QPs from a specific QPU.  The simplest way to add connection details is via the following command line arguments,
```
./dwig.py 
    -url <d-wave endpoint url>
    -token <sapi token>
    -solver <solver name>
    ran
```

Alternatively, a `_config` file can be placed in the D-WIG directory of the following form,
```
{
    "dw_url":"<d-wave endpoint url>",
    "dw_token":"<sapi token>",
    "dw_solver_name":"<solver name>"
}
```
The configuration file is a json document that can be use to set default values for all command line parameters.


### Viewing a B-QP

The Qubist Solver Visualization tool is helpful in understanding complex B-QP datasets.  To that end, the `bqp2qh.py` script converts a B-QP problem into the Qubist Hamiltonian format so that it can be viewed in the Solver Visualization tool.  For example, the following command will generate a 2-by-2 RAN1 problem in the qubist format and then print it to standard output,
```
./dwig.py -cd 2 ran | ./bqp2qh.py
```
To view this problem paste the terminal output into the Data tab of the Qubist Solver Visualization tool.


### Spin vs Boolean Variables

The B-QP format supports problems with spin variables (i.e. {-1,1}) and boolean variables (i.e. {0,1}).  However, the D-WIG toolset generates problems only using spin variables.  The `spin2bool.py` tool can be used to make the transformation after the problem is generated.  For example, the following  command will generate 2-by-2 RAN1 problem and convert it to a boolean variable space,
```
./dwig.py -cd 1 ran | ./spin2bool.py
```

### The QUBO Format

The QUBO format is supported by a variety of the tools provided by D-Wave, such as __qbsolv__, __aqc__, and __toq__.  The `bqp2qubo.py` tool can be combined with the `spin2bool.py` tool to convert D-WIG cases into the qubo format.  For example, the following  command will generate 2-by-2 RAN1 problem and convert it to the QUBO format,
```
./dwig.py -cd 1 ran | ./spin2bool.py | ./bqp2qubo.py
```

## Known Issues

The json schema validation library `jsonschema` is designed for python 3 while the `dwave-sapi2` library requires python 2.  Consequently, it takes about 2 seconds to load the compatibility libraries to use jsonschema in python 2.
